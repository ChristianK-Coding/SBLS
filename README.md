# SBLS
Spiking Broad Learning System is an attempt to realize a broad Learning System (BLS) with Spiking neurons.
This code was developed alongside the Master Thesis "Spike-based broad learning system for autonomous navigation"

This project uses the following dependencies:
python:         3.12.8
pytorch:        2.4.1
torchmetrics:   1.6.2
torchvision:    0.19.1
snntorch:       0.9.1
numpy:          2.2.0
cv2:            4.11.0.86
matplotlib:     3.9.4

To rerun one of the experiments, simply run the corresponding function in main.py with the parameters provided in the paper, or use your own parameters
